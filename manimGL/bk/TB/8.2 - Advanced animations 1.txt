Sorry for the lack of narration, hopefully for the next video my narrator will be available again.

The whole video is very informative and the resulting animations are so beautiful to watch. The outro was extremely beautiful too.

excellent and beautiful works!! can't help to notice, in update_rotate_move alpha function, the square2 should be mob

Yes, technically this should be the case, but we can also use objects outside the scope of the update function, that's why I did it like this.

Such an informative video ! Thanks a lot ! Can you please tell how to apply the add_updater( ) function to a list of mobjects?

You can use a for cycle, or apply the updater to a VGroup

Thanks for these videos.  They have helped me get started.  A small point but you have stroke_opatity when it should be stroke_opacity.
I am new to python (coming from C) - is there no way to get errors such as this to flag up a warning?  Python seems to be happy for you to write any old rubbish and seems to ignore stupid mistakes.   I am not sure I like that.

Python will spot a typo as an error, and tell you which line it is on :) You can't put any old rubbish in Python, otherwise my animations would look much better!

strange, but if I print variable  of object which I changed via method it shows me its base value.

Hello, nice video. I have a few questions, If I may, and they are from 10:30 animation (RotationAndMoveFail scene):
1. Why do you provide the parameter 'mob' to the 'update_rotate_move' function, if you don't use 'mob' anywhere inside the function?
2. Can we specify the step of alpha? In this video, it divides the line into 10 equal parts, and each step is 1/10 length. Can we somehow modify this fraction?
3. Since 'interpolate_mobject' is already in the source code, it means you are redefining this method to do something else?
4. Lastly, a question about RotateWithPath scene - I don't understand how does this code 'path.points[1:3] += UP*2' bend the path? I tried playing along with the numbers (2:5, or 1:4 instead 1:3), but it still didn't make sense to me.

Thanks

1. Yes, that was my mistake, they had already left me in the comments.
2. No, alpha depends on the video fps, you can't assign it yourself, but with the interpolate function you can change the range from (0,1) to any range. See the Alpha and dt examples video.
3. Where did I use interpolate_mobject?
4. Those are the bezier points, watch the Custom Graphs video.

I already saw where I used that method, yes, it is already defined in the Animation class, that is why it can be used.

@Theorem of Beethoven Thanks! Got it, I copied the screen_grid code into advanced_animation, and it now advanced animation worked.  Is there a way to do it where you don't have to copy the code into advnaced_animation?
